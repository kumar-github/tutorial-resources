## Overview

This library is simple and answers just **one** question, asked in two very different contexts:

> ### "How long did that take?"

Sometimes you ask this **once, deliberately** — while investigating a performance issue, writing a benchmark, or
comparing two implementations during development. Sometimes it is **not just once**, but you want the answer **always,
silently** — a permanent fixture in production code that logs elapsed time without anyone having to remember even it's
there.

`timing-utils` solves both the problems by providing one class for each context:

<div align="center">

|               | `StopWatch`                                                                     | `TimingLogger`                                              |
|---------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Use case**  | Situational, deliberate measurement — benchmarking, investigations, comparisons | Permanent, ambient measurement embedded in production code  |
| **Lifecycle** | Stateless static utility                                                        | Per-invocation `AutoCloseable` resource                     |
| **Lives**     | In a test, a debugger session, a benchmark harness                              | In the production code, inside any method body, **forever** |

</div>

Both are built around the same core idea — **measure in nanoseconds, report in milliseconds** — but deliberately take
different shapes to solve different problems.

---

## Why This Library Exists

Most Java codebases accumulate timing code in one of two unsatisfying forms:

- Scattered `System.nanoTime()` pairs with manual subtraction, duplicated across the codebase, straightforward to
  implement, also easy to get subtly wrong — forgetting unit conversions, measuring the wrong scope, or leaking
  timing code into business logic.

- Ad-hoc `try { ... } finally { log.debug("took {}ms", ...) }` blocks that vary in format from method to method,
  making logs hard to search or aggregate.

`timing-utils` exists to make both of these **boring** — a single, **non-invasive**, well-tested, consistent way to
answer *"How long did that take?"*, whether the answer is needed once during an investigation or every time, forever,
in production.

---

## Design Philosophy

These principles were established early in the design phase and applied across every class in the library:

- **No side effects.** Neither `StopWatch` nor `TimingLogger` retries, caches, modifies, or intercepts the measured
  method in any way. Any side effect you observe is the method's own.

- **Measure in nanos, report in millis.** `System.nanoTime()` is used internally for maximum precision. Millisecond
  conversions happen only at the point of retrieval — via `TimeUnit.NANOSECONDS.toMillis()` — so no rounding error
  accumulates during aggregation.

- **Always return, never throw (for repeated measurement).** `measureRepeatedly()` and `measureRepeatedlyChecked()`
  always return a result, even if any or every iteration fails. Failure information is **captured** and **surfaced** for
  inspection — **never rethrown**.

- **A slow failure is different from a slow success — keep them separate.** A failed iteration's elapsed time is
  meaningless in isolation: an instant validation failure and a 30-second timeout are both "failures," but averaging
  them tells you nothing useful about either. Failed timings are excluded from the successful performance statistics
  entirely. Failures are represented by a count and the last exception — which already conveys more than any timing
  could.

- **The right tool has the right shape.** `StopWatch` is a stateless static utility — every method receives everything
  it needs as parameters and returns everything it produces as a value, so no instance is needed. `TimingLogger` is an
  `AutoCloseable` instance and because it must capture `startNanos` at `start()` and use it in `close()`, potentially
  much later — that single `long` is state that must survive across the `try`-block's lifetime. Neither is forced into
  the other's shape for the sake of consistency.

## Getting Started

> [!NOTE]
> Maven Central coordinates will be published once the library reaches its first stable release. Until then, vendor
> the `dev.badprogrammer.util.timing` package directly into your project's source.

### Adding `timing-utils` to Your Project

**Option 1 — Build from source (available now)**

Clone the repository and install it to your local Maven repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dev-badprogrammer/timing-utils.git
cd timing-utils
mvn clean install
```

**Option 2 — Maven Central (coming soon)**

Once published, no build step is needed.

Either way, add the dependency to your `pom.xml`:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>dev.badprogrammer</groupId>
    <artifactId>timing-utils</artifactId>
    <version>LATEST_VERSION</version>
</dependency>
```

A minimal taste of both classes:

Measure a method once and return the result.

```java
// One-off measurement during an investigation
final TimedResult<User> timedResult = StopWatch.measure(() -> userService.getUserById(101));
System.out.println("TimedResult: " + timedResult);

// TimedResult: TimedResult[ElapsedMillis = 24ms, ElapsedNanos = 24568257ns]
```

Measure a method repeatedly and return the aggregated statistics across all iterations:

```java
// Repeated measurement during a serious performance investigation
final TimingStatistics stats = StopWatch.measureRepeatedly(() -> userService.getUserById(101), 20, 3);
System.out.println("Stats: " + stats);

// Stats: TimingStatistics[Total iterations = 20, Successful iterations = 20, Failed iterations = 0,
// Total elapsed time = 142ms, Average elapsed time = 7.120ms, Minimum elapsed time = 2ms,
// Maximum elapsed time = 13ms]
```

Measure a method permanently in production and log the result automatically:

```java
// Permanent production timing
public Connection getConnection() throws SQLException {
    try (TimingLogger timer = TimingLogger.start("getConnection", log)) {
        return dbUtils.getConnection();
    }
}

// 00:00:00.000 [main] DEBUG dev.badprogrammer.util.timing.examples.TimingLoggerDemo -- TIMED | getConnection |
// Elapsed = 38ms (38459480ns)
```

### Building and Running Tests

Standard Maven build:

```bash
mvn clean install   # builds the jar and runs the full test suite
mvn test            # runs tests only
```

## Features

### Single Measurement — `measure` / `measureChecked`

Times **one invocation** of a method and returns both its result and its elapsed time, wrapped in a `TimedResult<T>`.

A method that returns a value and does not declare a checked exception on its method signature:

```java
// Returns a value, no checked exception
final TimedResult<User> timedResult   = StopWatch.measure(() -> userService.getUserById(101));
final User              result        = timedResult.getResult();
final long              elapsedMillis = timedResult.getElapsedMillis();

System.out.println("TimedResult: " + timedResult);
System.out.println("Result: " + result);
System.out.printf("ElapsedMillis: %dms", elapsedMillis);

// TimedResult: TimedResult[ElapsedMillis = 78ms, ElapsedNanos = 78284284ns]
// Result: User[id=101, name=John Doe]
// ElapsedMillis: 78ms
```

A method that does not return a value (void) and does not declare a checked exception on its method signature:

```java
// Void method, no checked exception
final TimedResult<Void> timedResult   = StopWatch.measure(() -> eventPublisher.publishEvent());
final Void              result        = timedResult.getResult();
final long              elapsedMillis = timedResult.getElapsedMillis();

System.out.println("TimedResult: " + timedResult);
System.out.println("Result: " + result);
System.out.printf("ElapsedMillis: %dms", elapsedMillis);

// TimedResult[ElapsedMillis = 3ms, ElapsedNanos = 3033608ns]
// Result: null
// ElapsedMillis: 3ms
```

A method that returns a value and declares a checked exception on its method signature:

```java
// Returns a value, declares a checked exception
final TimedResult<Connection> timedResult   = StopWatch.measureChecked(() -> dbUtils.getConnection());
final Connection              result        = timedResult.getResult();
final long                    elapsedMillis = timedResult.getElapsedMillis();

System.out.println("TimedResult: " + timedResult);
System.out.println("Result: " + result);
System.out.printf("ElapsedMillis: %dms", elapsedMillis);

// TimedResult: TimedResult[ElapsedMillis = 11ms, ElapsedNanos = 11797399ns]
// Result: org.postgresql.jdbc.PgConnection@5e9f23b4
// ElapsedMillis: 11ms
```

A method that does not return a value (void) and declares a checked exception on its method signature:

```java
// Void method declares a checked exception
final TimedResult<Void> timedResult   = StopWatch.measureChecked(() -> dbUtils.closeConnection());
final Void              result        = timedResult.getResult();
final long              elapsedMillis = timedResult.getElapsedMillis();

System.out.println("TimedResult: " + timedResult);
System.out.println("Result: " + result);
System.out.printf("ElapsedMillis: %dms", elapsedMillis);

// TimedResult: TimedResult[ElapsedMillis = 6ms, ElapsedNanos = 6338845ns]
// Result: null
// ElapsedMillis: 6ms
```

#### Method naming convention

Every measurement method in this library comes in two variants — `measure` and `measureChecked`. The name itself tells
you which one to reach for:

| If your method                                                    | Use                                  |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| **returns a value** and **does not declares** a checked exception | `measure(Supplier<T>)`               |
| **is `void`** and **does not declares** a checked exception       | `measure(Runnable)`                  |
| **returns a value** and **declares** a checked exception          | `measureChecked(CheckedSupplier<T>)` |
| **is `void`** and **declares** a checked exception                | `measureChecked(CheckedRunnable)`    |

This naming convention is used consistently for `measureRepeatedly` / `measureRepeatedlyChecked` as well, and will be
extended to the upcoming `compare`, `compareChecked` methods.

---

### Repeated Measurement — `measureRepeatedly` / `measureRepeatedlyChecked`

Invokes a method a fixed number of times and returns a `TimingStatistics` — statistics across all **successful**
invocations, plus failure tracking.

```java
final TimingStatistics stats = StopWatch.measureRepeatedlyChecked(() -> dbUtils.getConnection(), 1000, 5);
System.out.println(stats);

if (stats.hasFailures()) {
    stats.getLastException()
         .ifPresent(
              e -> log.warn("{} of {} iterations failed: {}", stats.getFailedIterations(), stats.getTotalIterations(), e.getMessage()));
}
```

#### Warmup iterations

The first `warmupIterations` invocations run normally — their side effects happen — but their timings are **excluded**
from statistics. This prevents JVM class-loading and JIT compilation overhead from skewing the numbers for an
otherwise well-optimized method.

#### Failure handling

If an invocation throws:

- the failure count is incremented,

- the exception is retained as the **last exception**,

- execution **continues** with the next iteration,

- and the failed iteration's timing is **excluded** from statistics.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> `measureRepeatedly` and `measureRepeatedlyChecked` **always return** a `TimingStatistics` — even if *every single
> iteration* fails. There is nothing to catch.

```java
// All 1000 iterations fail — still returns a valid result, never throws
TimingStatistics stats = StopWatch.measureRepeatedly(() -> unreliableCall(), 1000, 0);
stats.hasFailures();              // true
stats.getFailedIterations();      // 1000
stats.getSuccessfulIterations();  // 0
stats.getLastException();         // Optional containing the last exception thrown
```

#### `TimingStatistics` accessors

| Method                                    | Returns                                                   |
|-------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| `getTotalNanos()`, `getTotalMillis()`     | Sum of elapsed time across successful iterations          |
| `getAverageNanos()`, `getAverageMillis()` | Mean elapsed time per successful iteration                |
| `getMinNanos()`, `getMinMillis()`         | Fastest successful iteration                              |
| `getMaxNanos()`, `getMaxMillis()`         | Slowest successful iteration                              |
| `getSuccessfulIterations()`               | Count of iterations that did not throw                    |
| `getFailedIterations()`                   | Count of iterations that threw                            |
| `getTotalIterations()`                    | `getSuccessfulIterations() + getFailedIterations()`       |
| `hasFailures()`                           | `true` if any iteration threw                             |
| `getLastException()`                      | `Optional<Exception>` — the last exception thrown, if any |

---

### Ambient Production Timing — `TimingLogger`

A **non-invasive** `AutoCloseable` that times a method body and logs the elapsed time automatically when the `try`
block exits — normally **or** via exception.

```java
public Connection getConnection() throws SQLException {
    try (TimingLogger timer = TimingLogger.start("getConnection", log)) {
        return dbUtils.getConnection();
    }
}
// Logs: TIMED | getConnection | Elapsed = 12ms (12004311ns)
```

#### Slow-call detection

Pass a threshold in milliseconds. If elapsed time exceeds it, the log line escalates from `DEBUG` to `WARN` —
automatically, with **no code change**:

```java
try(TimingLogger timer = TimingLogger.start("getConnection", log, 1000)){
        return dbUtils.getConnection();
}
// Normal: DEBUG TIMED | getConnection | Elapsed = 12ms (12004311ns)
// Slow: WARN TIMED | getConnection | Elapsed = 1340ms (1340291884ns) | SLOW
```

> [!TIP]
> Passing `0` (or omitting the parameter entirely) disables threshold checking — every invocation logs at `DEBUG`. `0`
> is a deliberate, valid sentinel — only **negative** values are rejected.

#### Why the caller's logger is mandatory

> [!NOTE]
> `TimingLogger.start()` requires **your** logger, not a shared internal one. This ensures timing lines appear under
> your class's name in the logs — filterable by package, routable by your existing logging configuration, and sitting
> alongside your class's other log statements. A shared `timing.TimingLogger` logger would scatter timing lines under
> an unrelated logger name, losing all context.

#### Log levels at a glance

| Condition                          | Level   | Example |
|------------------------------------|---------|---------|
| No threshold configured            | `DEBUG` | `TIMED  | getConnection | Elapsed = 12ms (12004311ns)`            |
| Threshold configured, not exceeded | `DEBUG` | `TIMED  | getConnection | Elapsed = 12ms (12004311ns)`            |
| Threshold configured and exceeded  | `WARN`  | `TIMED  | getConnection | Elapsed = 1340ms (1340291884ns) | SLOW` |

`DEBUG` keeps timing lines invisible at typical production log levels (`INFO`, `WARN`) until you need them. The `SLOW`
escalation surfaces problems automatically.

#### `close()` never throws

> [!WARNING]
> `close()` is the one method in this library with an absolute guarantee — it **never throws**, under any circumstance.
> A `close()` that throws inside `try`-with-resources can suppress the *original* exception from the `try` block,
> silently swallowing real errors. Any unexpected failure inside `close()` itself is caught and logged at `ERROR` as a
> last resort.

---

### Supporting Types

#### `TimedResult<T>`

Immutable holder for a single invocation's return value and elapsed time.

```java
public T getResult();             // the method's return value (null for void methods)

public long getElapsedNanos();    // full precision

public long getElapsedMillis();   // converted from nanos via TimeUnit
```

#### `CheckedSupplier<T>` / `CheckedRunnable`

Functional interfaces equivalent to `Supplier<T>` and `Runnable`, but declaring `throws Exception` on their single
abstract method. This lets you pass a lambda that throws a checked exception (`SQLException`, `IOException` etc.)
directly to `measureChecked` / `measureRepeatedlyChecked`, without forcing you to wrap it in a try/catch just to satisfy
the compiler:

```java
// Without CheckedSupplier — forced wrapping, original type lost
Supplier<Connection> s = () -> {
    try {
        return dbUtils.getConnection();
    }
    catch (SQLException e) {
        throw new RuntimeException(e);
    }
};

// With CheckedSupplier — clean and direct, original type preserved
CheckedSupplier<Connection> s = () -> dbUtils.getConnection();
```

---

## Design Decisions & Their Reasoning

This section documents *why* the library looks the way it does — including a few decisions that were taken initially
but later revisited and corrected along the way.

### Why `measure` / `measureChecked` instead of one overloaded method

Java cannot cleanly disambiguate `Supplier<T>` from `CheckedSupplier<T>` via overloading when a lambda body doesn't
declare any exception — the compiler reports an ambiguous method call. Splitting into two explicitly named methods
removes the ambiguity entirely and makes the exception-handling expectation visible at the call site, without the caller
needing to know *why*.

---

### Why `Runnable` / `CheckedRunnable` variants delegate internally

Rather than duplicating the timing loop for void methods, `measure(Runnable)` and `measureRepeatedly(Runnable, ...)`
adapt their input to `Supplier<Void>` / `CheckedSupplier<Void>` and delegate to the value-returning variant. One
implementation, one place to get the timing logic right.

---

### `TimedResult`: nanos internally, millis on retrieval

Elapsed time is captured via `System.nanoTime()` and stored as-is. Millisecond conversion happens only when
`getElapsedMillis()` is called, via `TimeUnit.NANOSECONDS.toMillis()` — never by manual division. This keeps the
conversion consistent everywhere it's used and avoids subtle rounding bugs from repeated division.

---

### `TimingStatistics`: built on `LongSummaryStatistics`

Total, average, min, and max are delegated entirely to `java.util.LongSummaryStatistics` — a battle-tested JDK class. No
custom arithmetic is performed for these core statistics, eliminating an entire category of off-by-one or precision
bugs.

---

### The big correction: failure timings do **not** belong in performance statistics

An earlier design included failed-iteration timings directly in the statistics, on the reasoning that *"a slow failure
is as real a data point as a slow success."* That reasoning sounds correct in isolation — but it doesn't survive the
question **"how would a caller actually use that number?"** in a repeatedly measured method.

In practice, the elapsed time until an exception is thrown depends entirely on *where* in the method the failure
occurred — an instant validation error and a 30-second connection timeout are both "failures," but their timings mean
completely different things and cannot be meaningfully averaged together. Mixing them into `getAverageMillis()`
contaminates the picture of how the method performs *when it works*, without providing any actionable insight in
return — the exception type and message already convey far more about *what* went wrong than its timing does.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **The resolution:** statistics (`LongSummaryStatistics` and all derived accessors) cover **successful iterations only
> **. Failures are represented separately and explicitly via `getFailedIterations()`, `hasFailures()`, and
> `getLastException()`.

---

### The second correction: "always return, never throw"

The original design for `measureRepeatedly` re-threw the *last* exception after the loop completed if any iteration had
failed. This created a contradiction: if even one out of a thousand iterations failed, the caller received an exception
and **lost the statistics for the other 999** — directly undermining the goal of returning useful aggregated data.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **The resolution:** `measureRepeatedly` and `measureRepeatedlyChecked` *always* return a `TimingStatistics`. The
> last exception (if any) is attached to the result and inspected via `getLastException()` rather than caught. As a
> direct consequence, `measureRepeatedlyChecked` no longer declares `throws Exception` — it has nothing left to throw.

---

### Warmup iterations are a first-class concept, not an afterthought

JIT compilation and class loading make the first few invocations of *any* method artificially slow — this has nothing to
do with the method's real performance. Rather than asking callers to discard early results manually, `warmupIterations`
is a required parameter: those invocations execute (with real side effects) but are excluded from every statistic.

---

### `StopWatch` is static; `TimingLogger` is an instance — and that's correct

`StopWatch` is a stateless utility — every method receives everything it needs as parameters and returns a result. This
is the same shape as `java.util.Arrays` or `java.util.Collections`, and a private constructor enforces it cannot be
instantiated.

`TimingLogger`, by contrast, **must** carry state — specifically, the start time captured when `start()` is called —
across to `close()`, which may happen much later in a different point of the method body. `AutoCloseable` requires an
instance with a lifecycle; there is no honest way to make this static. Each class has the shape its responsibilities
demand, rather than being forced into uniformity for its own sake.

---

### `TimingLogger`'s threshold: `0` means "no threshold," and `< 0` is invalid

`NO_THRESHOLD = 0L` is a deliberate, user-passable sentinel — calling `start(label, logger, 0)` is equivalent to calling
the no-threshold overload `start(label, logger)`. Validation rejects only **negative** values (`slowThresholdMillis <
0`), not zero, because zero has a legitimate meaning here rather than being a degenerate edge case to reject.

---

## ✅ Best Practices

- ✅ **Use `StopWatch` for investigations, benchmarks, and one-off questions.** It is not intended to live permanently in
  production hot paths — Use `TimingLogger` for those usecases.

- ✅ **Always give `measureRepeatedly` a meaningful warmup count.** A handful of warmup iterations (5–10 is often enough)
  prevent JIT warm-up from dominating your results, especially for short-running methods.

- ✅ **Inspect failures, don't catch them.** `measureRepeatedly` and `measureRepeatedlyChecked` never throw — check
  `hasFailures()` and `getLastException()` after the call rather than wrapping it in `try`/`catch`.

- ✅ **Pass your own class's logger to `TimingLogger`.** This keeps timing lines filterable and contextual alongside your
  other log output — never share a single logger across unrelated classes.

- ✅ **Set slow thresholds based on real SLAs, not guesses.** A threshold that fires constantly is noise; a threshold
  that never fires provides no value. Tune it against your actual latency expectations.

- ✅ **Don't mix `measure` and `measureChecked` mentally — let the compiler guide you.** If your lambda doesn't compile
  under `measure`, that's the signal to use `measureChecked` instead, not to wrap the exception yourself.

## Implementation Status & Roadmap

This project grows feature by feature — each one fully designed and discussed before it's built. This section reflects
that: a flat list of what exists, an ordered list of what's committed to next, and an open-ended list of ideas that have
been discussed or being discussed, but not yet promised.

### ✅ Implemented

- Single measurement — `measure`, `measureChecked`

- Repeated measurement — `measureRepeatedly`, `measureRepeatedlyChecked`

- Failure tracking — `hasFailures()`, `getLastException()`

- Ambient production timing — `TimingLogger`

### 🔜 Roadmap

Committed next steps, in order:

1. Head-to-head comparison — `compare`, `compareChecked` methods returning a `ComparisonResult`

2. `Candidate` based comparison API — replaces the six-argument `compare` signature with a paired label-and-method input

3. Percentile statistics — `getPercentileMillis()` for P50 / P75 / P95 / P99 on `TimingStatistics`

### 💭 Future Considerations

Ideas raised during design discussions, not yet committed to. Some may be implemented, refined, or set aside as the
library matures:

- **`toMap()` on `ComparisonResult`** — a flat `Map<String, Object>` representation for external consumption (metrics
  platforms, structured logging, MDC) without coupling the library to a JSON dependency

- **MDC integration for `TimingLogger`** — attaching elapsed time to the logging context rather than (or in addition to)
  a log line; depends on the consuming application's log-aggregation stack

- **Spring AOP `@Timed` module** — an optional, separate module providing an annotation-based alternative to
  `TimingLogger` for Spring Boot consumers, without adding a Spring dependency to the core library

#### ❌ Considered and rejected

- **Checkpoint / `CheckpointTimer`** — a mechanism for recording multiple named splits within a single timed block.
  Rejected as too invasive: it would require call sites to thread a checkpoint object through their method body,
  contradicting the "no side effects, no restructuring required" principle that both `StopWatch` and `TimingLogger` are
  built on.
